# Portfolio App

Portfolio App is an Android version of my portfolio. It is updated with my latest CV.

## Motivation

I want to take this project as a chance to review my Android development knowledge. Portfolio application is an exciting project for beginners, with many potential features to be implemented.

## Features

**NEW**: additional features I develop for my portfolio version.

- [x] Home section
- [x] Education section
- [x] Work section
- [x] Project section
- [x] Dark mode (of course) **NEW**
- [ ] A Google Map showing my home (last resort for shippers, or when you don't want to deal with District 12 address rule)
- [ ] Contact section that opens other applications for faster connection.

## Credits

Youtuber [**Aws Rh**](https://youtu.be/-Cf7sQ2HobQ) gave me the idea and impressed me with his minimalist design. I decided to fork his project at [aws1994](https://github.com/aws1994)/**[PortfolioApp](https://github.com/aws1994/PortfolioApp)** and make my own version on top of it.
